# Implementation Documentation

## Tech Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - Context API - For state management

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment
  - Express.js - Web application framework
  - MongoDB - NoSQL database for data persistence
  - Mongoose - MongoDB object modeling tool



## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x)
- npm (v9.x or higher)

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anandjha8719/best-todo.git
   cd best-todo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Install concurrently package
   npm install

   # Install frontend and backend dependencies simultaneously
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   ```bash

   # Start frontend and backend
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` and the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

### Architecture

- **Microservices Approach**: The application is designed with a clear separation between frontend and backend services, allowing them to be deployed and scaled independently.

- **RESTful API Design**: The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations, following standard HTTP methods and status codes.

- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens are used for authentication and authorization, providing a stateless mechanism for user sessions.

### Database Design

- MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility with document-based structures and scalability.
- Data is organized into collections with appropriate indexes for optimized query performance.
- Mongoose schemas include validation rules to ensure data integrity.

### Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.
- Input validation is performed on all API endpoints.
- CORS is configured to restrict access to the API.
- Environment variables are used for sensitive configuration.

### UI/UX Decisions

- Responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices.
- Accessibility features implemented following WCAG guidelines.
- Loading states and error handling for improved user experience.
- Dark/light theme support based on user preference.

## Additional Features and Improvements

### Performance Optimizations

- Implemented code splitting to reduce initial load time.
- Added caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
- Optimized images and assets for web delivery.
- Implemented lazy loading for components not needed on initial render.

### Monitoring and Logging

- Integrated error tracking with Sentry.
- Added comprehensive logging with Winston.
- Implemented API request and response logging for debugging.

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated testing runs on every pull request.
- Code quality checks with ESLint and Prettier.
- Automated deployment to staging environment upon merging to develop branch.
- Production deployment requires manual approval.

### Future Enhancements

- Real-time functionality using WebSockets.
- Implement advanced search features using Elasticsearch.
- Add multi-language support.
- Integrate with third-party services for enhanced functionality.

## Setup Scripts

The repository includes several utility scripts to streamline development and deployment:

### Database Setup

```bash
# Run from the server directory
npm run db:setup
```

This script initializes the database with required collections and seed data.

### Development Utilities

```bash
# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run linting across all files
npm run lint

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

### Deployment Scripts

```bash
# Build production assets
npm run build

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:prod
```
